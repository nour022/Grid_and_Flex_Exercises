### Instructions

> - Work in the existing `index.html` and `style.css` files
> - The arrow icons are from **Fontawesome** - please use the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements
> - Take advantage of the `flex` property - `position` is not needed for this layout
> - Use semantic html tags i.e. `<section>` for your sections
> - The page should cover the entire width and height of the browser window
> - The font we are using is _Roboto_ from **Google Fonts**
> - Use `:hover` effects where you feel necessary
> - As always, **pixel perfect** :)
