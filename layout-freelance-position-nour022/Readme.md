### Keep in Mind

- The hero section at the top of the page should use the `header.jpg` image supplied in the `images` folder.
- Use semantic tags i.e. `<header>`, `<nav>` etc.
- The **HOME** button is always in the same position, as shown in the online version.
- `::before` and `::after` pseudo elements should be used to create the four dots in the main section ;)
- For the three cards at the bottom change their `z-index` on `:hover`

Good luck and have fun!
