# Fixed Vanishing Header

Create a webpage like in the design mockup shown below.

![design mockup](fixed-vanishing-header.gif)

### Specifications

- The navbar should always stay at the top of the page when scrolling
- The background image and header title should stay fixed when scrolling
- The content should go on top of the header when scrolling, so we see an effect of the header slowly getting "eaten up"
- Use any image you like, or use `unsplash.it/500/500` for a random dummy image

#### Good luck and have fun!
